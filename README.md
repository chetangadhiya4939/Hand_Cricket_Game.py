# Hand Cricket Game

This Python script implements a featured hand cricket game where the player competes against the computer by batting and bowling. In hand cricket, players take turns to bat and bowl, and they score runs based on the number they choose. The objective is to score more runs than the opponent or to get the opponent out by matching their chosen number.

## How to Play

1. Run the script `HandCricketGame.py`.
2. Choose to bat or bowl first.
3. Enter a number between 1 and 10 to bat or bowl.
4. The computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 10 to bat or bowl.
5. If the numbers match, the player is out, and the innings ends. Otherwise, the runs scored in that ball are added to the total score.
6. After the first innings, swap roles with the computer for the second innings.
7. The player with the higher total score wins the game.
8. If both the innings have same runs then it will tie! and again 1 over match will be there.
